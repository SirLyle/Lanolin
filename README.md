Lanolin
========
A Minecraft mod
---------------

Lanolin is a mod that adds (surprise) lanolin.
A resource obtained from smelting sheeps' wool which can be applied to water to make it water resistant.

Water Resitance is a armor bonus that extends how long a wearer can hold their breath, but it wears off.
A suit of fully water resitant armor increases the time you can hold your breath by over a minute (64 seconds) before it has to be reapplied.

To apply lanolin to armor, simply craft them together.
Crafting with lanolin preserves NBT data on the item, so you don't lose enchantments.
